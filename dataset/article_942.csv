Temporal Planning with Temporal Metric Trajectory Constraints

AAAI Technical Track: Planning, Routing, and Scheduling
In several industrial applications of planning, complex temporal metric trajectory constraints are needed to adequately model the problem at hand. For example, in production plants, items must be processed following a “recipe” of steps subject to precise timing constraints. Modeling such domains is very challenging in existing action-based languages due to the lack of sufficiently expressive trajectory constraints.
