Student Abstracts
Previous research has shown that estimating full-body poses from a minimal sensor set using a trained ANN without explicitly enforcing time coherence has resulted in output pose sequences that occasionally show undesired jitter. To mitigate such effect, we propose to improve the ANN output by combining it with a state prediction using a Kalman Filter. Preliminary results are promising, as the jitter effects are diminished. However, the overall error does not decrease substantially.
