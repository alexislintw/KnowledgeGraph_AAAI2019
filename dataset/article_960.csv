Weighted model counting has recently been extended to weighted model integration, which can be used to solve hybrid probabilistic reasoning problems. Such problems involve both discrete and continuous probability distributions. We show how standard knowledge compilation techniques (to SDDs and d-DNNFs) apply to weighted model integration, and use it in two novel solvers, one exact and one approximate solver. Furthermore, we extend the class of employable weight functions to actual probability density functions instead of mere polynomial weight functions.
