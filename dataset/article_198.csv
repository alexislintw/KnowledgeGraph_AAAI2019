AAAI Technical Track: Constraint Satisfaction and Optimization
Current Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) algorithms based on successive calls to a powerful Satisfiability (SAT) solver are now able to solve real-world instances in many application domains. Moreover, replacing the SAT solver with a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver enables effective MaxSMT algorithms. However, MaxSMT has seldom been used in debugging multi-threaded software.
