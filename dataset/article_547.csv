Split-Merge MCMC (Monte Carlo Markov Chain) is one of the essential and popular variants of MCMC for problems when an MCMC state consists of an unknown number of components. It is well known that state-of-the-art methods for split-merge MCMC do not scale well. Strategies for rapid mixing requires smart and informative proposals to reduce the rejection rate. However, all known smart proposals involve expensive operations to suggest informative transitions. As a result, the cost of each iteration is prohibitive for massive scale datasets. It is further known that uninformative but computationally efficient proposals, such as random split-merge, leads to extremely slow convergence. This tradeoff between mixing time and per update cost seems hard to get around.
