Nearest neighbor search is a fundamental computational tool and has wide applications. In past decades, many datastructures have been developed to speed up this operation. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical datastructure for nearest neighbor search in moderately high dimension. Our proposed method maintains good run time guarantees, and it outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in practice.
