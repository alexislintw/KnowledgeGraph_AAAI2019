Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) is a virtualization technology that hosts desktop operating system on centralized server in a data center of private or public cloud. Effective resource management is of crucial importance for VDI customers, where maintaining sufficient virtual machines helps guarantee satisfactory user experience while turning off spare virtual machines helps save running cost. Generally, existing techniques work in passive manner by either driving available capacity reactively or configuring management schedules manually. In this paper, a novel proactive resource management approach is proposed which aims to predict VDI pool workload adaptively by utilizing CoArse to Fine historical dEscriptive (CAFE) features. Specifically, aggregate session count from pool end users serves as the basis for workload measurement and predictive model induction. Extensive experiments on real VDI customers data sets clearly validate the effectiveness of multi-grained features for VDI workload prediction. Furthermore, practical insights identified in our VDI data analytics are also discussed.
