Attributed description logic is a recently proposed formalism, targeted for graph-based representation formats, which enriches description logic concepts and roles with finite sets of attribute-value pairs, called annotations. One of the most important uses of annotations is to record provenance information. In this work, we first investigate the complexity of satisfiability and query answering for attributed DL-LiteR ontologies. We then propose a new semantics, based on provenance semirings, for integrating provenance information with query answering. Finally, we establish complexity results for satisfiability and query answering under this semantics.
