We describe the selection, implementation and online evaluation of two e-commerce recommender systems developed with our partner company, Prediggo. The first one is based on the novel method of Bayesian Variable-order Markov Modeling (BVMM). The second, SSAGD, is a novel variant of the Matrix-Factorization technique (MF), which is considered state-of-the-art in the recommender literature.
