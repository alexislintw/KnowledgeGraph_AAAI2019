This paper presents a framework to integrate Science and Computing teaching using Logic Programming. We developed two modules: one for chemistry and the other for chemistry and physics. They are implemented in an elective course for 8th graders. Through clinical interviews, video taped class observations, exit interviews and our own experiences with the class, Logic Programming based approach is accessible to the students.
