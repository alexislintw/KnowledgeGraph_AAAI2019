Student Abstracts
The process of arguing is also the process of justifying and explaining. Here, we focus on argumentative explanations in Abstract Bipolar Argumentation. We propose new defence and acceptability semantics, which operates on both attack and support relations, and use them to formalize two types of explanations, concise and strong explanations. We also show how to compute the explanations with Bipolar Dispute Trees.
