Student Abstracts
We consider the problem of mobilizing community effort to reposition indiscriminantly parked shared bikes in urban environments through crowdsourcing. We propose an ethically aligned incentive optimization approach WSLS which maximizes the rate of success for bike repositioning while minimizing cost and prioritizing usersâ€™ wellbeing. Realistic simulations based on a dataset from Singapore demonstrate that WSLS significantly outperforms existing approaches.
