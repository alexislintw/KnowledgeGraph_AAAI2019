The inverse geodesic length (IGL) is a well-known and widely used measure of network performance. It equals the sum of the inverse distances of all pairs of vertices. In network analysis, IGL of a network is often used to assess and evaluate how well heuristics perform in strengthening or weakening a network. We consider the edge-deletion problem MINIGLED. Formally, given a graph G, a budget k, and a target inverse geodesic length T, the question is whether there exists a subset of edges X with |X| ≤ ck, such that the inverse geodesic length of G − X is at most T.
