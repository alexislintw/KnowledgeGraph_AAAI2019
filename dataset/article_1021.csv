We propose a temporal action detection by spatial segmentation framework, which simultaneously categorize actions and temporally localize action instances in untrimmed videos. The core idea is the conversion of temporal detection task into a spatial semantic segmentation task. Firstly, the video imprint representation is employed to capture the spatial/temporal interdependences within/among frames and represent them as spatial proximity in a feature space. Subsequently, the obtained imprint representation is spatially segmented by a fully convolutional network. With such segmentation labels projected back to the video space, both temporal action boundary localization and per-frame spatial annotation can be obtained simultaneously. The proposed framework is robust to variable lengths of untrimmed videos, due to the underlying fixed-size imprint representations. The efficacy of the framework is validated in two public action detection datasets.
