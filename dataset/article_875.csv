Hypernymy is a basic semantic relation in computational linguistics that expresses the “is-a” relation between a generic concept and its specific instances, serving as the backbone in taxonomies and ontologies. Although several NLP tasks related to hypernymy prediction have been extensively addressed, few methods have fully exploited the large number of hypernymy relations in Web-scale taxonomies.
