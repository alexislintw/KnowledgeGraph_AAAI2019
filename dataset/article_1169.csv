High Occupancy Vehicle/High Occupancy Tolling (HOV/HOT) lanes are operated based on voluntary HOV declarations by drivers. A majority of these declarations are wrong to leverage faster HOV lane speeds illegally. It is a herculean task to manually regulate HOV lanes and identify these violators. Therefore, an automated way of counting the number of people in a car is prudent for fair tolling and for violator detection.
