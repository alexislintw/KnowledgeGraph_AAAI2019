This paper proposes a novel end-to-end deep learning approach for robust co-saliency detection by simultaneously learning highlevel group-wise semantic representation as well as deep visual features of a given image group. The inter-image interaction at semantic-level as well as the complementarity between group semantics and visual features are exploited to boost the inferring of co-salient regions. Specifically, the proposed approach consists of a co-category learning branch and a co-saliency detection branch. While the former is proposed to learn group-wise semantic vector using co-category association of an image group as supervision, the latter is to infer precise co-salient maps based on the ensemble of group semantic knowledge and deep visual cues. The group semantic vector is broadcasted to each spatial location of multi-scale visual feature maps and is used as a top-down semantic guidance for boosting the bottom-up inferring of co-saliency. The co-category learning and co-saliency detection branches are jointly optimized in a multi-task learning manner, further improving the robustness of the approach. Moreover, we construct a new large-scale co-saliency dataset COCO-SEG to facilitate research of co-saliency detection.

Utilization of MA is, to the best of our knowledge, a new idea in the field of SG. The novelty of proposed solution lies specifically in efficient chromosome-based game encoding and dedicated local improvement heuristics.

Another advantage is an iteration-based construction of the system, which makes the approach essentially an anytime method.

Recently selection hyperheuristics choosing between a collection of elitist randomised local search heuristics with different neighbourhood sizes have been shown to optimise a standard unimodal benchmark function from evolutionary computation in the optimal expected runtime achievable with the available low-level heuristics. In this paper we extend our understanding to the domain of multimodal optimisation by considering a hyper-heuristic from the literature that can switch between elitist and nonelitist heuristics during the run. We first identify the range of parameters that allow the hyper-heuristic to hillclimb efficiently and prove that it can optimise a standard hillclimbing benchmark function in the best expected asymptotic time achievable by unbiased mutation-based randomised search heuristics. Afterwards, we use standard multimodal benchmark functions to highlight function characteristics where the hyper-heuristic is efficient by swiftly escaping local optima and ones where it is not. For a function class called CLIFFd where a new gradient of increasing fitness can be identified after escaping local optima, the hyper-heuristic is extremely efficient while a wide range of established elitist and non-elitist algorithms are not, including the well-studied Metropolis algorithm.

While recent work has made much progress in automatic music generation in the symbolic domain, few attempts have been made to build an AI model that can render realistic music audio from musical scores. Directly synthesizing audio with sound sample libraries often leads to mechanical and deadpan results, since musical scores do not contain performance-level information, such as subtle changes in timing and dynamics. Moreover, while the task may sound like a text-to-speech synthesis problem, there are fundamental differences since music audio has rich polyphonic sounds. To build such an AI performer, we propose in this paper a deep convolutional model that learns in an end-to-end manner the score-to-audio mapping between a symbolic representation of music called the pianorolls and an audio representation of music called the spectrograms. The model consists of two subnets: the ContourNet, which uses a U-Net structure to learn the correspondence between pianorolls and spectrograms and to give an initial result; and the TextureNet, which further uses a multi-band residual network to refine the result by adding the spectral texture of overtones and timbre.

Here, we introduce a GPU-based implementation of LiFE that achieves 50-100x speedups over conventional CPU-based implementations for connectome sizes of up to several million fibers. Briefly, the algorithm accelerates generalized matrix multiplications on a compressed tensor through efficient GPU kernels, while ensuring favorable memory access patterns. Leveraging these speedups, we advance LiFE\u2019s algorithm by imposing a regularization constraint on estimated fiber weights during connectome pruning. Our regularized, accelerated, LiFE algorithm (\u201cReAl-LiFE\u201d) estimates sparser connectomes that also provide more accurate fits to the underlying diffusion signal. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by classifying pathological signatures of structural connectivity in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD).

Motivated by this, a new problem called community focusing (CF) is studied. It finds a community where the members are close and densely connected to the query nodes. A distance-sensitive dense subgraph structure called \u03b2-attention-core is proposed to remove the vertices loosely connected to or far from the query nodes, and a combinational density is designed to guarantee the density of a subgraph. Then CF is formalized as finding a subgraph with the largest combinational density among the \u03b2-attention-core subgraphs containing the query nodes with the largest \u03b2.

When a statistical characteristic is desired, often an adequate regularizer can be designed and applied during the training phase. Typically, such a regularizer aims to manipulate a statistical characteristic over all classes together. For classification tasks, however, it might be advantageous to enforce the desired characteristic per class such that different classes can be better distinguished. Motivated by the idea, we design two class-wise regularizers that explicitly utilize class information: class-wise Covariance Regularizer (cw-CR) and classwise Variance Regularizer (cw-VR). cw-CR targets to reduce the covariance of representations calculated from the same class samples for encouraging feature independence. cw-VR is similar, but variance instead of covariance is targeted to improve feature compactness. For the sake of completeness, their counterparts without using class information, Covariance Regularizer (CR) and Variance Regularizer (VR), are considered together. The four regularizers are conceptually simple and computationally very efficient, and the visualization shows that the regularizers indeed perform distinct representation shaping.

The challenges are two-fold: firstly, the table-to-text datasets often contain large number of attributes across different domains, thus it is hard for the encoder to incorporate these heterogeneous resources. Secondly, the single encoder also has difficulties in modeling the complex attribute-value structure of the tables. To this end, we first propose a two-level hierarchical encoder with coarse-to-fine attention to handle the attribute-value structure of the tables.

We first investigate the problem of identifiability when all the available data is biased. We prove that the algorithm proposed by [Bareinboim and Tian, 2015] is, in fact, complete, namely, whenever the algorithm returns a failure condition, no identifiability claim about the causal relation can be made by any other method. We then generalize this setting to when, in addition to the biased data, another piece of external data is available, without bias. It may be the case that a subset of the covariates could be measured without bias (e.g., from census).

LPOM is block multiconvex in all layer-wise weights and activations. This allows us to use block coordinate descent to update the layer-wise weights and activations. Most notably, we only use the mapping of the activation function itself, rather than its derivative, thus avoiding the gradient vanishing or blow-up issues in gradient based training methods. So our method is applicable to various non-decreasing Lipschitz continuous activation functions, which can be saturating and non-differentiable. LPOM does not require more auxiliary variables than the layer-wise activations, thus using roughly the same amount of memory as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) does. Its parameter tuning is also much simpler. We further prove the convergence of updating the layer-wise weights and activations and point out that the optimization could be made parallel by asynchronous update.

In this paper, we propose to alleviate the trade-off between accuracy and explainability by developing an explainable deep model that combines the advantages of deep learning-based models and existing explainable methods. The basic idea is to build an initial network based on an explainable deep hierarchy (e.g., Microsoft Concept Graph) and improve the model accuracy by optimizing key variables in the hierarchy (e.g., node importance and relevance). To ensure accurate rating prediction, we propose an attentive multi-view learning framework. The framework enables us to handle sparse and noisy data by co-regularizing among different feature levels and combining predictions attentively. To mine readable explanations from the hierarchy, we formulate personalized explanation generation as a constrained tree node selection problem and propose a dynamic programming algorithm to solve it.

In this paper, we propose a Deep Hierarchical Structure (DHS) method to handle the hierarchical structure of an arbitrary height with a convex objective function. The DHS method relies on the exponents of the edge weights in the hierarchical structure but the exponents need to be given by users or set to be identical by default, which may be suboptimal. Based on the DHS method, we propose a variant to learn the exponents from data. Moreover, we consider a case where even the hierarchical structure is not available. Based on the DHS method, we propose a Learning Deep Hierarchical Structure (LDHS) method which can learn the hierarchical structure via a generalized fused-Lasso regularizer and a proposed sequential constraint.

However, one sample can be represented by various hash codes with different lengths, and thus there must be some associations and relationships among these different hash codes because they represent the same sample. Therefore, harnessing these relationships will boost the performance of hashing methods. Inspired by this possibility, in this study, we propose a new model jointly multiple hash learning (JMH), which can learn hash codes with multiple lengths simultaneously. In the proposed JMH method, three types of information are used for hash learning, which come from hash codes with different lengths, the original features of the samples and label. In contrast to the existing hashing methods, JMH can learn hash codes with different lengths in one step. Users can select appropriate hash codes for their retrieval tasks according to the requirements in terms of accuracy and complexity. To the best of our knowledge, JMH is one of the first attempts to learn multi-length hash codes simultaneously.

Moreover, since the prediction score of our proposed model for a sample is a sum of contribution scores of the bins and grid cells that this sample lies in low-dimensional subspaces, it works similar like a scoring system which only involves data binning and score addition.

The proposed Compressive Convolutional Network (CCN) is basically a compressive-sensing-enabled convolutional neural network. Instead of designing different components for compressive sensing and object detection, the CCN optimizes and reuses the convolution operation for recoverable data embedding and image compression. Technically, the incoherence condition, which is the sufficient condition for recoverable data embedding, is incorporated in the first convolutional layer of the CCN model as regularization; Therefore, the CCN convolution kernels learned by training over the VOC and COCO image set can be used for data embedding and image compression. By reusing the convolution operation, no extra computational overhead is required for image compression. As a result, the CCN is 3.1 to 5.0 fold more efficient than the conventional approaches.

Meanwhile, advances in deep learning have enabled us to solve increasingly complex control tasks mapping visual input to motor commands.

The first type begins by recovering the missing action information from demonstrations and then leverages existing imitation learning algorithms on the full state-action trajectories. Our preliminary work has shown that learning an inverse dynamics model of the agent in a self-supervised fashion and then inferring the actions performed by the demonstrator enables sufficient action recovery for this purpose. The second type of algorithm uses model-free end-to-end learning.

The corpus is constructed via Unfun.me, an online game that incentivizes players to make minimal edits to satirical headlines with the goal of making other players believe the results are serious headlines. The edit operations used to successfully remove humor pinpoint the words and concepts that play a key role in making the original, satirical headline funny.

This paper proposes a Low-rank based Efficient Outlier Detection (LEOD) framework to achieve favorable robustness against high outlier ratios with much cheaper computations. Specifically, it is worth highlighting the following aspects of LEOD: (1) Our framework exploits the low-rank structure embedded in the similarity matrix and considers inliers/outliers equally based on this low-rank structure, which facilitates us to encourage satisfying robustness with low computational cost later; (2) A novel re-weighting algorithm is derived as a new general solution to the constrained eigenvalue problem, which is a major bottleneck for the optimization process.

Essentially, such loss should establish a robust metric to efficiently distinguish high-dimensional features within and outside fine-grained categories. To this end, the existing loss functions are defected in two aspects: (a) The feature relationship is encoded inside the training batch. Such a local scope leads to low accuracy. (b) The error is established by the mean square, which needs pairwise distance computation in training set and results in low efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel metric learning scheme, termed Normalize-Scale Layer and Decorrelated Global Centralized Ranking Loss, which achieves extremely efficient and discriminative learning, i.e., 5\u00d7 speedup over triplet loss and 12% recall boost on CARS196. Our method originates from the classic softmax loss, which has a global structure but does not directly optimize the distance metric as well as the inter/intra class distance. We tackle this issue through a hypersphere layer and a global centralized ranking loss with a pairwise decorrelated learning. In particular, we first propose a Normalize-Scale Layer to eliminate the gap between metric distance (for measuring distance in retrieval) and dot product (for dimension reduction in classification). Second, the relationship between features is encoded under a global centralized ranking loss, which targets at optimizing metric distance globally and accelerating learning procedure. Finally, the centers are further decorrelated by Gram-Schmidt process, leading to extreme efficiency (with 20 epochs in training procedure) and discriminability in feature learning.

Recent researches argue that the complex network may have the hyperbolic geometry underneath, because the underlying hyperbolic geometry can naturally reflect some properties of complex network, e.g., hierarchical and power-law structure. In this paper, we make the first effort toward HIN embedding in hyperbolic spaces. We analyze the structures of two real-world HINs and discover some properties, e.g., the power-law distribution, also exist in HIN.

Then we exploit the distance in hyperbolic spaces as the proximity measurement. The hyperbolic distance is able to meet the triangle inequality and well preserve the transitivity in HIN. Our model enables the nodes and their neighborhoods have small hyperbolic distances. We further derive the effective optimization strategy to update the hyperbolic embeddings iteratively.

We propose the use of geometry-aware flow, which serves as a wellsuited representation for modeling the transformation between instance-level facial attributes. Specifically, we leverage the facial landmarks as the geometric guidance to learn the differentiable flows automatically, despite of the large pose gap existed. Geometry-aware flow is able to warp the source face attribute into the target face context and generate a warp-and-blend result. To compensate for the potential appearance gap between source and target faces, we propose a hallucination sub-network that produces an appearance residual to further refine the warp-and-blend result. Finally, a cycle-consistency framework consisting of both attribute transfer module and attribute removal module is designed, so that abundant unpaired face images can be used as training data.

The actions in such plans, however, are not the actions in the instances themselves, which are not necessarily common to other instances, but abstract actions that are defined on a set of common features. The formulation assumes that the features and the abstract actions are given. In this work, we address this limitation by showing how to learn them automatically. The resulting account of generalized planning combines learning and planning in a novel way: a learner, based on a Max SAT formulation, yields the features and abstract actions from sampled state transitions, and a FOND planner uses this information, suitably transformed, to produce the general plans.

In order to improve the performance in inferring target labels, we propose a targetspecific network which is capable of learning collaboratively with a domain adaptation network, instead of directly minimizing domain discrepancy. A clustering regularization is also utilized to improve the generalization capability of the target-specific network by forcing target data points to be close to accumulated class centers. As this network learns and specializes to the target domain, its performance in inferring target labels improves, which in turn facilitates the learning process of the adaptation network. Therefore, there is a mutually beneficial relationship between these two networks.

In this paper, we alleviate this problem by preserving local neighborhood structure of short texts, enabling to spread topical signals among neighboring documents, so as to correct the inaccurate topic representations. This is achieved by using variational manifold regularization, constraining the close short texts should have similar variational topic representations. Upon this idea, we propose a novel Laplacian DMM (LapDMM) topic model.

However, when attacking a deployed machine learning service, one can only acquire the input-output correspondences of the target model; this is the so-called black-box attack setting. The major drawback of existing black-box attacks is the need for excessive model queries, which may give a false sense of model robustness due to inefficient query designs. To bridge this gap, we propose a generic framework for query-efficient blackbox attacks. Our framework, AutoZOOM, which is short for Autoencoder-based Zeroth Order Optimization Method, has two novel building blocks towards efficient black-box attacks: (i) an adaptive random gradient estimation strategy to balance query counts and distortion, and (ii) an autoencoder that is either trained offline with unlabeled data or a bilinear resizing operation for attack acceleration. Experimental results suggest that, by applying AutoZOOM to a state-of-the-art black-box attack (ZOO), a significant reduction in model queries can be achieved without sacrificing the attack success rate and the visual quality of the resulting adversarial examples. In particular, when compared to the standard ZOO method, AutoZOOM can consistently reduce the mean query counts in finding successful adversarial examples (or reaching the same distortion level) by at least 93% on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, leading to novel insights on adversarial robustness.", "authors": ["Chun-Chen Tu", "Paishun Ting", "Pin-Yu Chen", "Sijia Liu", "Huan Zhang", "Jinfeng Yi", "Cho-Jui Hsieh", "Shin-Ming Cheng"], "section": "AAAI Technical Track: AI for Social Impact"}, "Strategic Tasks for Explainable Reinforcement Learning": {"abstract": "Commonly used sequential decision making tasks such as the games in the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) provide rich observation spaces suitable for deep reinforcement learning.

To be able to generate multiple probable human-pose sequences, conditioned on a given starting sequence, we introduce a random extrinsic factor r, drawn from a predefined prior distribution. Furthermore, to enforce a direct content loss on the predicted motion sequence and also to avoid mode-collapse, a novel bidirectional framework is incorporated by modifying the usual discriminator architecture. The discriminator is trained also to regress this extrinsic factor r, which is used alongside with the intrinsic factor (encoded starting pose sequence) to generate a particular pose sequence. To further regularize the training, we introduce a novel recursive prediction strategy. In spite of being in a probabilistic framework, the enhanced discriminator architecture allows predictions of an intermediate part of pose sequence to be used as a conditioning for prediction of the latter part of the sequence. The bidirectional setup also provides a new direction to evaluate the prediction quality against a given test sequence. For a fair assessment of BiHMP-GAN, we report performance of the generated motion sequence using (i) a critic model trained to discriminate between real and fake motion sequence, and (ii) an action classifier trained on real human motion dynamics.

We find that the talking face sequence is actually a composition of both subject-related information and speech-related information. These two spaces are then explicitly disentangled through a novel associative-and-adversarial training process. This disentangled representation has an advantage where both audio and video can serve as inputs for generation.

With these limiting distributions, we can avoid bootstraps or simulations to determine the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis, which makes the ELR statistics more efficient than the recently proposed linear statistic, finite set Stein discrepancy (FSSD). We also prove the consistency of the ELR statistics, which guarantees that the test power goes to 1 as the number of samples goes to infinity.

To mitigate these problems, this paper proposes a novel discrepancy measure called source-guided discrepancy (S-disc), which exploits labels in the source domain unlike the existing ones. As a consequence, S-disc can be computed efficiently with a finitesample convergence guarantee.

The existing attempts on this problem still have the following limitations: 1) the underlying semantic information of the missing views is commonly ignored; 2) The local structure of data is not well explored; 3) The importance of different views is not effectively evaluated. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Unified Embedding Alignment Framework (UEAF) for robust incomplete multi-view clustering. In particular, a locality-preserved reconstruction term is introduced to infer the missing views such that all views can be naturally aligned. A consensus graph is adaptively learned and embedded via the reverse graph regularization to guarantee the common local structure of multiple views and in turn can further align the incomplete views and inferred views. Moreover, an adaptive weighting strategy is designed to capture the importance of different views.

SAFE adopts recurrent neural network (RNN) to handle user activity sequences and directly outputs hazard values at each timestamp, and then, survival probability derived from hazard values is deployed to achieve consistent predictions. Because we only observe the user suspended time instead of the fraudulent activity time in the training data, we revise the loss function of the regular survival model to achieve fraud early detection.

ADEM (Lowe et al. 2017) formulated the automatic evaluation of dialogue systems as a learning problem and showed that such a model was able to predict responses which correlate significantly with human judgements, both at utterance and system level. Their system was shown to have beaten word-overlap metrics such as BLEU with large margins. We start with the question of whether an adversary can game the ADEM model. We design a battery of targeted attacks at the neural network based ADEM evaluation system and show that automatic evaluation of dialogue systems still has a long way to go. ADEM can get confused with a variation as simple as reversing the word order in the text! We report experiments on several such adversarial scenarios that draw out counterintuitive scores on the dialogue responses. We take a systematic look at the scoring function proposed by ADEM and connect it to linear system theory to predict the shortcomings evident in the system. We also devise an attack that can fool such a system to rate a response generation system as favorable.

First, we model a face representation with an intrinsic identity information and its within-person variations. By exploring the disentangled latent variable space, a variational lower bound is employed to optimize the approximate posterior for NIR and VIS representations. Second, aiming at obtaining more compact and discriminative disentangled latent space, we impose a minimization of the identity information for the same subject and a relaxed correlation alignment constraint between the NIR and VIS modality variations. An alternative optimization scheme is proposed for the disentangled variational representation part and the heterogeneous face recognition network part.

The primary goal of this method is to accelerate the inference process through the transformation, but there can be many other practical applications. The method is based on block-wise recasting; it recasts each source block in a pre-trained teacher network to a target block in a student network. For the recasting, a target block is trained such that its output activation approximates that of the source block. Such a block-by-block recasting in a sequential manner transforms the network architecture while preserving the accuracy. This method can be used to transform an arbitrary teacher network type to an arbitrary student network type. It can even generate a mixed-architecture network that consists of two or more types of block. The network recasting can generate a network with fewer parameters and/or activations, which reduce the inference time significantly. Naturally, it can be used for network compression by recasting a trained network into a smaller network of the same type.

However, most existing techniques which specifically aim at English materials may lose effectiveness on this task due to the huge difference between Chinese and English. Actually, as a special kind of hieroglyphics, Chinese characters and radicals are semantically useful but still unexplored in the task of text classification. To that end, in this paper, we first analyze the motives of using multiple granularity features to represent a Chinese text by inspecting the characteristics of radicals, characters and words. For better representing the Chinese text and then implementing Chinese text classification, we propose a novel Radicalaware Attention-based Four-Granularity (RAFG) model to take full advantages of Chinese characters, words, characterlevel radicals, word-level radicals simultaneously. Specifically, RAFG applies a serialized BLSTM structure which is context-aware and able to capture the long-range information to model the character sharing property of Chinese and sequence characteristics in texts. Further, we design an attention mechanism to enhance the effects of radicals thus model the radical sharing property when integrating granularities. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments, where the experimental results not only show the superiority of our model, but also validate the effectiveness of radicals in the task of Chinese text classification.", "authors": ["Hanqing Tao", "Shiwei Tong", "Hongke Zhao", "Tong Xu", "Binbin Jin", "Qi Liu"], "section": "AAAI Technical Track: Machine Learning"}, "RSA: Byzantine-Robust Stochastic Aggregation Methods for Distributed Learning from Heterogeneous Datasets": {"abstract": "In this paper, we propose a class of robust stochastic subgradient methods for distributed learning from heterogeneous datasets at presence of an unknown number of Byzantine workers.

The key to the proposed methods is a regularization term incorporated with the objective function so as to robustify the learning task and mitigate the negative effects of Byzantine attacks. The resultant subgradient-based algorithms are termed Byzantine-Robust Stochastic Aggregation methods, justifying our acronym RSA used henceforth. In contrast to most of the existing algorithms, RSA does not rely on the assumption that the data are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) on the workers, and hence fits for a wider class of applications. Theoretically, we show that: i) RSA converges to a near-optimal solution with the learning error dependent on the number of Byzantine workers; ii) the convergence rate of RSA under Byzantine attacks is the same as that of the stochastic gradient descent method, which is free of Byzantine attacks.

This encourages us to learn segmentation by generating realistic composite images. To achieve this, we propose a novel framework that exploits a new proposed prior called the independence prior based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The generator produces an image with multiple category-specific instance providers, a layout module and a composition module. Firstly, each provider independently outputs a category-specific instance image with a soft mask. Then the provided instances\u2019 poses are corrected by the layout module. Lastly, the composition module combines these instances into a final image. Training with adversarial loss and penalty for mask area, each provider learns a mask that is as small as possible but enough to cover a complete category-specific instance. Weakly supervised semantic segmentation methods widely use grouping cues modeling the association between image parts, which are either artificially designed or learned with costly segmentation labels or only modeled on local pairs. Unlike them, our method automatically models the dependence between any parts and learns instance segmentation. We apply our framework in two cases: (1) Foreground segmentation on category-specific images with box-level annotation. (2) Unsupervised learning of instance appearances and masks with only one image of homogeneous object cluster (HOC). We get appealing results in both tasks, which shows the independence prior is useful for instance segmentation and it is possible to unsupervisedly learn instance masks with only one image.", "authors": ["Songmin Dai", "Xiaoqiang Li", "Lu Wang", "Pin Wu", "Weiqin Tong", "Yimin Chen"], "section": "AAAI Technical Track: Machine Learning"}, "Abduction-Based Explanations for Machine Learning Models": {"abstract": "The growing range of applications of Machine Learning (ML) in a multitude of settings motivates the ability of computing small explanations for predictions made.

The captured depth image, however, usually contains noise and black holes which noticeably hamper gaze tracking. Thus we propose a CNN-based multi-task learning framework to simultaneously refine depth images and predict gaze points. We utilize a generator network for depth image generation with a Generative Neural Network (GAN), where the generator network is partially shared by both the gaze tracking network and GAN-based depth synthesizing. By optimizing the whole network simultaneously, depth image synthesis improves gaze point estimation and vice versa. Since the only existing RGBD dataset (EYEDIAP) is too small, we build a large-scale RGBD gaze tracking dataset for performance evaluation. As far as we know, it is the largest RGBD gaze dataset in terms of the number of participants.

In this paper, with the real datasets in Ant Credit Pay of Ant Financial Services Group, we first study the cashout user detection problem and propose a novel hierarchical attention mechanism based cash-out user detection model, called HACUD. Specifically, we model different types of objects and their rich attributes and interaction relations in the scenario of credit payment service with an Attributed Heterogeneous Information Network (AHIN). The HACUD model enhances feature representation of objects through meta-path based neighbors exploiting different aspects of structure information in AHIN.

Currently, two approaches for learning embeddings of novel words exist: (i) learning an embedding from the novel word\u2019s surface-form (e.g., subword n-grams) and (ii) learning an embedding from the context in which it occurs. In this paper, we propose an architecture that leverages both sources of information \u2013 surface-form and context \u2013 and show that it results in large increases in embedding quality.

The policy is found using an extension to Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) which bounds probability of failure. We apply MCTS to a sequence of approximating problems, which allows constraint satisfying actions to be found in an anytime manner. Our innovation lies in defining the approximating problems and replanning strategy such that the probability of failure constraint is guaranteed to be satisfied over the true policy. The approach does not need to plan for all measurements explicitly or constrain planning based only on the measurements that were observed. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to enforce probability of failure constraints in adaptive sampling.

RS3CIS uses a local representation method that projects the original data into a low-dimensional subspace through a row-sparse transformation matrix and uses the `2,1-norm of the transformation matrix as a penalty term to achieve noise suppression. In addition, RS3CIS introduces Laplacian matrix rank constraint so that it can output an affinity graph with an explicit clustering structure, which makes the final clustering result to be obtained in a single-step of constructing an affinity matrix.

As opposed to the weak Stackelberg equilibrium (WSE), the SSE assumes that the follower breaks ties in favor of the leader and this is widely acknowledged and justified by the assertion that the defender can often induce the attacker to choose a preferred action by making an infinitesimal adjustment to her strategy. Unfortunately, in security games with resource assignment constraints, the assertion might not be valid; it is possible that the defender cannot induce the desired outcome. As a result, many results claimed in the literature may be overly optimistic. To remedy, we first formally define the utility guarantee of a defender strategy and provide examples to show that the utility of SSE can be higher than its utility guarantee. Second, inspired by the analysis of leader\u2019s payoff by Von Stengel and Zamir (2004), we provide the solution concept called the inducible Stackelberg equilibrium (ISE), which owns the highest utility guarantee and always exists. Third, we show the conditions when ISE coincides with SSE and the fact that in general case, SSE can be extremely worse with respect to utility guarantee.

The types of interaction among items are usually divided into individual-level interaction that can stand out the transition order between a pair of items, or union-level relation between a set of items and single one. However, most of existing work only captures one of them from a single view, especially on modeling the individual-level interaction. In this paper, we propose a Multi-order Attentive Ranking Model (MARank) to unify both individual- and union-level item interaction into preference inference model from multiple views. The idea is to represent user\u2019s short-term preference by embedding user himself and a set of present items into multi-order features from intermedia hidden status of a deep neural network.

It targets at finding the dictionary over which the training set admits a maximally sparse representation. Most existing DL algorithms are based on solving an optimization problem, where the noise variance and sparsity level should be known as the prior knowledge. However, in practice applications, it is difficult to obtain these knowledge. Thus, non-parametric Bayesian DL has recently received much attention of researchers due to its adaptability and effectiveness. Although many hierarchical priors have been used to promote the sparsity of the representation in non-parametric Bayesian DL, the problem of redundancy for the dictionary is still overlooked, which greatly decreases the performance of sparse coding. To address this problem, this paper presents a novel robust dictionary learning framework via Bayesian inference. In particular, we employ the orthogonality-promoting regularization to mitigate correlations among dictionary atoms. Such a regularization, encouraging the dictionary atoms to be close to being orthogonal, can alleviate overfitting to training data and improve the discrimination of the model. Moreover, we impose Scale mixture of the Vector variate Gaussian (SMVG) distribution on the noise to capture its structure. A Regularized Expectation Maximization Algorithm is developed to estimate the posterior distribution of the representation and dictionary with orthogonality-promoting regularization.

Intuitively, this balances the losses to have the same scale. We demonstrate theoretical considerations that motivate this approach from multiple viewpoints, including connecting it to optimizing the geometric mean of the expectation of each loss, an objective that ignores the scale of losses. Experimentally, the adaptive weights induce more competitive anytime predictions on multiple recognition data-sets and models than non-adaptive approaches including weighing all losses equally. In particular, anytime neural networks (ANNs) can achieve the same accuracy faster using adaptive weights on a small network than using static constant weights on a large one.

First we prove E(sgn(x)y) = \u221a2/\u03c0\u03c1, which provides an estimator for \u03c1. Interestingly this estimator can be substantially improved by normalizing y. Then we study estimators based on E (y\u22121x\u22650 + y+1x<0) and its normalized version. We analyze the theoretical limit (using the MLE) and conclude that, among the proposed estimators, no single estimator can achieve (close to) the theoretical optimal asymptotic variance, for the entire range of \u03c1. On the other hand, the estimators can be combined to achieve the variance close to that of the MLE. In applications such as near neighbor search, duplicate detection, knn-classification, etc, the training data are first transformed via random projections and then only the signs of the projected data points are stored (i.e., the sgn(x)). The original training data are discarded. When a new data point arrives, we apply random projections but we do not necessarily need to quantize the projected data (i.e., the y) to 1-bit.

It has been shown that the generalization error bound in terms of the path norm explains the empirical generalization behaviors of the ReLU neural networks better than that of other capacity measures. Moreover, optimization algorithms which take path norm as the regularization term to the loss function, like Path-SGD, have been shown to achieve better generalization performance. However, the path norm counts the values of all paths, and hence the capacity measure based on path norm could be improperly influenced by the dependency among different paths. It is also known that each path of a ReLU network can be represented by a small group of linearly independent basis paths with multiplication and division operation, which indicates that the generalization behavior of the network only depends on only a few basis paths. Motivated by this, we propose a new norm Basis-path Norm based on a group of linearly independent paths to measure the capacity of neural networks more accurately. We establish a generalization error bound based on this basis path norm, and show it explains the generalization behaviors of ReLU networks more accurately than previous capacity measures via extensive experiments.

In particular, PIL takes full advantage of the similar image pairs with diverse answers to an identical question provided in VQA2.0 dataset. It builds a multi-modal embedding space to project pos./neg. feature pairs, upon which word vectors of answers are modeled as anchors. By doing so, PIL strengthens the importance of visual features in prediction with a novel dynamic-margin based triplet loss that efficiently increases the semantic discrepancies between pos./neg. image pairs.

In this paper, we introduce Point-View Relation Network (PVRNet), an effective network designed to well fuse the view features and the point cloud feature with a proposed relation score module. More specifically, based on the relation score module, the point-single-view fusion feature is first extracted by fusing the point cloud feature and each single view feature with point-singe-view relation, then the pointmulti- view fusion feature is extracted by fusing the point cloud feature and the features of different number of views with point-multi-view relation. Finally, the point-single-view fusion feature and point-multi-view fusion feature are further combined together to achieve a unified representation for a 3D shape. Our proposed PVRNet has been evaluated on ModelNet40 dataset for 3D shape classification and retrieval.

In this paper, we suggest that for each individual label, the final prediction involves the collaboration between its own prediction and the predictions of other labels. Based on this assumption, we first propose a novel method to learn the label correlations via sparse reconstruction in the label space.

MCS uses multiple levels of multi-armed bandits to determine the best layers, communities and node roles for selecting nodes to query. We test MCS against six baseline algorithms on real-world multiplex networks, and achieved large gains in performance.

To learn from PML training examples, the training procedure is prone to be misled by the false positive labels concealed in candidate label set. In light of this major difficulty, a novel two-stage PML approach is proposed which works by eliciting credible labels from the candidate label set for model induction. In this way, most false positive labels are expected to be excluded from the training procedure.

One such architecture is the scaled Cayley orthogonal recurrent neural network (scoRNN) which parameterizes the orthogonal recurrent weight matrix through a scaled Cayley transform. This parametrization contains a diagonal scaling matrix consisting of positive or negative one entries that can not be optimized by gradient descent. Thus the scaling matrix is fixed before training and a hyperparameter is introduced to tune the matrix for each particular task.

However, we find that though one may have good results by direct clustering based on such network embedding features, there is ample room for improvement. More seriously, in many real networks, some statisticallysignificant nodes which play pivotal roles are often divided into incorrect communities using network embedding methods. This is because while some distance measures are used to capture the spatial relationship between nodes by embedding, the nodes after mapping to feature vectors are essentially not coupled any more, losing important structural information. To address this problem, we propose a general Markov Random Field (MRF) framework to incorporate coupling in network embedding which allows better detecting network communities. By smartly utilizing properties of MRF, the new framework not only preserves the advantages of network embedding (e.g. low complexity, high parallelizability and applicability for traditional machine learning), but also alleviates its core drawback of inadequate representations of dependencies via making up the missing coupling relationships. Experiments on real networks show that our new approach improves the accuracy of existing embedding methods (e.g. Node2Vec, DeepWalk and MNMF), and corrects most wrongly-divided statistically-significant nodes, which makes network embedding essentially suitable for real community detection applications.

When the objective involves the expected total reward only, this simplification works perfectly. However, when the objective is risk-sensitive, this simplification leads to an incorrect value. We propose three successively more general state-augmentation transformations (SATs), which preserve the reward sequences as well as the reward distributions and the optimal policy in risk-sensitive reinforcement learning. In risk-sensitive scenarios, firstly we prove that, for every MDP with a stochastic transition-based reward function, there exists an MDP with a deterministic state-based reward function, such that for any given (randomized) policy for the first MDP, there exists a corresponding policy for the second MDP, such that both Markov reward processes share the same reward sequence. Secondly we illustrate that two situations require the proposed SATs in an inventory control problem. One could be using Q-learning (or other learning methods) on MDPs with transition-based reward functions, and the other could be using methods, which are for the Markov processes with a deterministic state-based reward functions, on the Markov processes with general reward functions.

In this paper, we propose to address these two problems by improving the quality of decoder hidden representations via two auxiliary regularization terms in the training process of an NAT model. First, to make the hidden states more distinguishable, we regularize the similarity between consecutive hidden states based on the corresponding target tokens. Second, to force the hidden states to contain all the information in the source sentence, we leverage the dual nature of translation tasks (e.g., English to German and German to English) and minimize a backward reconstruction error to ensure that the hidden states of the NAT decoder are able to recover the source side sentence. Extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets show that both regularization strategies are effective and can alleviate the issues of repeated translations and incomplete translations in NAT models.

To resolve both the aspect granularity inconsistency and feature mismatch between domains, we propose a Multi-Granularity Alignment Network (MGAN). In MGAN, a novel Coarse2Fine attention guided by an auxiliary task can help the AC task modeling at the same finegrained level with the AT task. To alleviate the feature false alignment, a contrastive feature alignment method is adopted to align aspect-specific feature representations semantically.

First, most existing online feature selection algorithms merely utilize the first-order information of the data streams, regardless of the fact that second-order information explores the correlations between features and significantly improves the performance. Second, most online feature selection algorithms are based on the balanced data presumption, which is not true in many real-world applications. For example, in fraud detection, the number of positive examples are much less than negative examples because most cases are not fraud. The balanced assumption will make the selected features biased towards the majority class and fail to detect the fraud cases. We propose an Adaptive Sparse Confidence-Weighted (ASCW) algorithm to solve the aforementioned two problems. We first introduce an `0-norm constraint into the second-order confidence-weighted (CW) learning for feature selection. Then the original loss is substituted with a cost-sensitive loss function to address the imbalanced data issue. Furthermore, our algorithm maintains multiple sparse CW learner with the corresponding cost vector to dynamically select an optimal cost.

For example, an accurate taxi demand prediction can assist taxi companies in pre-allocating taxis. The key challenge of traffic prediction lies in how to model the complex spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics. Although both factors have been considered in modeling, existing works make strong assumptions about spatial dependence and temporal dynamics, i.e., spatial dependence is stationary in time, and temporal dynamics is strictly periodical. However, in practice the spatial dependence could be dynamic (i.e., changing from time to time), and the temporal dynamics could have some perturbation from one period to another period. In this paper, we make two important observations: (1) the spatial dependencies between locations are dynamic; and (2) the temporal dependency follows daily and weekly pattern but it is not strictly periodic for its dynamic temporal shifting. To address these two issues, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Dynamic Network (STDN), in which a flow gating mechanism is introduced to learn the dynamic similarity between locations, and a periodically shifted attention mechanism is designed to handle long-term periodic temporal shifting.

We also propose an alternative soft normalization penalty that can be minimized online and obviates the need for an explicit projection step. We complement our analysis with an empirical evaluation of the two techniques in an off-policy setting on the game Pong from the Atari domain where we find discounted COP-TD to be better behaved in practice than the soft normalization penalty.

Among such new quantification methods, one particular family stands out due to its accuracy, simplicity, and ability to operate with imbalanced training samples: Mixture Models (MM). Despite these desirable traits, MM, as a class of algorithms, lacks a more in-depth understanding concerning the influence of internal parameters on its performance. In this paper, we generalize MM with a base framework called DyS: Distribution y-Similarity. With this framework, we perform a thorough evaluation of the most critical design decisions of MM models. For instance, we assess 15 dissimilarity functions to compare histograms with varying numbers of bins from 2 to 110 and, for the first time, make a connection between quantification accuracy and test sample size, with experiments covering 24 public benchmark datasets. We conclude that, when tuned, Tops\u00f8e is the histogram distance function that consistently leads to smaller quantification errors and, therefore, is recommended to general use, notwithstanding Hellinger Distance\u2019s popularity. To rid MM models of the dependency on a choice for the number of histogram bins, we introduce two dissimilarity functions that can operate directly on observations.

While hidden units might capture such properties, the network is not always able to learn such constraints from the training data alone, and practitioners must then resort to post-processing. In this paper, we present an inference method for neural networks that enforces deterministic constraints on outputs without performing rule-based post-processing or expensive discrete search.

Therefore, unsupervised domain adaptation, which does not require labels for target data, is receiving a lot of attention.

Since such unilateral transformations transfer knowledge in the source domain to the target one without reducing dimensionality, the proposed method can effectively perform domain adaptation without losing information to be transfered. With the proposed method, it is assumed that the transformed features and the original features differ by a small residual to preserve the relationship between features and labels. This transformation is learned by aligning the higher-order moments of the source and target feature distributions based on the maximum mean discrepancy, which enables to compare two distributions without density estimation.

Through our analysis, we find the problem of RNNLM comes from the usage of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) as the objective function, which requires the generated distribution to precisely recover the true distribution. Such requirement favors high generation diversity which restricted the generation quality. This is not suitable when the overall quality is low, since high generation diversity usually indicates lot of errors rather than diverse good samples.

As a consequence, these approaches may be difficult to apply in resource-scarce domains or by scientists with limited in-depth knowledge of embedding models. In this paper, we propose a new heuristic to train temporal word embeddings based on the Word2vec model. The heuristic consists in using atemporal vectors as a reference, i.e., as a compass, when training the representations specific to a given time interval. The use of the compass simplifies the training process and makes it more efficient.

This ability, which has been called an agent\u2019s execution skill, is an important characteristic of an agent which can have a significant impact on their success. In this paper, we address the problem of estimating the execution skill of an agent given observations of that agent acting in a domain. Each observation includes the executed action and a description of the state in which the action was executed and the reward received, but notably excludes the action that the agent intended to execute. We previously introduced this problem and demonstrated that estimating an agent\u2019s execution skill is possible under certain conditions. Our previous method focused entirely on the reward that the agent received from executed actions and assumed that the agent was able to select the optimal action for each state. This paper addresses the execution skill estimation problem from an entirely different perspective, focusing instead on the action that was executed. We present a Bayesian framework for reasoning about action observations and show that it is able to outperform previous methods under the same conditions.

Despite various insightful results in this direction, there seems to be an overlooked dichotomy in the type of stability-based generalization bounds we have in the literature. On one hand, the literature seems to suggest that exponential generalization bounds for the estimated risk, which are optimal, can be only obtained through stringent, distribution independent and computationally intractable notions of stability such as uniform stability. On the other hand, it seems that weaker notions of stability such as hypothesis stability, although it is distribution dependent and more amenable to computation, can only yield polynomial generalization bounds for the estimated risk, which are suboptimal. In this paper, we address the gap between these two regimes of results. In particular, the main question we address here is whether it is possible to derive exponential generalization bounds for the estimated risk using a notion of stability that is computationally tractable and distribution dependent, but weaker than uniform stability. Using recent advances in concentration inequalities, and using a notion of stability that is weaker than uniform stability but distribution dependent and amenable to computation, we derive an exponential tail bound for the concentration of the estimated risk of a hypothesis returned by a general learning rule, where the estimated risk is expressed in terms of the deleted estimate.

Additionally, we offer a new way to draw insights from values of the value function, which allow associating specific interactions to their proxy ratings. We introduce two new metrics to represent ratings - one, customer-level and the other, aggregate-level for click actions across customers. Both are defined around proportion of all pairwise, successive actions that show increase in proxy ratings. This intuitive customer-level metric enables gauging the dynamics of ratings over time and is a better predictor of purchase than customer ratings from survey.

In particular, we design an attribute-based CNN with multiple branches, where each branch is responsible for classifying the target under a specific attribute. Such a design reduces the appearance diversity of the target under each attribute and thus requires less data to train the model. We combine all attributespecific features via ensemble layers to obtain more discriminative representations for the final target/background classification. The proposed method achieves favorable performance on the OTB100 dataset compared to state-of-the-art tracking methods.

Previous studies typically utilize human-engineered features to represent brain connectivity networks, but these features may not be well coordinated with subsequent classifiers. Besides, brain networks are often equipped with multiple hubs (i.e., nodes occupying a central position in the overall organization of a network), providing essential clues to describe connectivity patterns. However, existing studies often fail to explore such hubs from brain connectivity networks. To address these two issues, we propose a Connectivity Network analysis method with discriminative Hub Detection (CNHD) for brain disease diagnosis using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data.

We provide evidence that the reason for this is that the sparse representation provides locality, and so avoids catastrophic interference, and particularly keeps consistent, stable values for bootstrapping. We then discuss how to learn such sparse representations. We explore the idea of Distributional Regularizers, where the activation of hidden nodes is encouraged to match a particular distribution that results in sparse activation across time.

The photo-scene encoder contains two subencoders, namely the photo and scene encoders, which are stacked together and behave hierarchically to fully exploit the structure information of the photos within an album. Specifically, the photo encoder generates semantic representation for each photo while exploiting temporal relationships among them. The scene encoder, relying on the obtained photo representations, is responsible for detecting the scene changes and generating scene representations. Subsequently, the decoder dynamically and attentively summarizes the encoded photo and scene representations to generate a sequence of album representations, based on which a story consisting of multiple coherent sentences is generated. In order to fully extract the useful semantic information from an album, a reconstructor is employed to reproduce the summarized album representations based on the hidden states of the decoder.

Inspired by the recent advances in multirelational knowledge representation learning and deep neural networks, this paper proposes a novel Translation-based Neural Fashion Compatibility Modeling (TransNFCM) framework, which jointly optimizes fashion item embeddings and category-specific complementary relations in a unified space via an end-to-end learning manner. TransNFCM places items in a unified embedding space where a category-specific relation (category-comp-category) is modeled as a vector translation operating on the embeddings of compatible items from the corresponding categories.

The gradient-free (zeroth-order) method can address these problems because only the objective function values are required in the optimization.

For medical images, due to huge inter-subject variations or disease-specific effects on subjects, there exist several difficult-to-segment cases that are often overlooked by the previous works. To address this challenge, we propose a difficulty-aware deep segmentation network with confidence learning for end-to-end segmentation. The proposed framework has two main contributions: 1) Besides the segmentation network, we also propose a fully convolutional adversarial network for confidence learning to provide voxel-wise and region-wise confidence information for the segmentation network. We relax the adversarial learning to confidence learning by decreasing the priority of adversarial learning, so that we can avoid the training imbalance between generator and discriminator. 2) We propose a difficulty-aware attention mechanism to properly handle hard samples or hard regions considering structural information, which may go beyond the shortcomings of focal loss.

We then establish analytical and algorithmic results about the existence of a fair classifier in the context of supervised learning. Our results readily imply a simple, but rather counter-intuitive, strategy for eliminating latent discrimination. In order to prevent other features proxying for sensitive features, we need to include sensitive features in the training phase, but exclude them in the test/evaluation phase while controlling for their effects. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on several realworld datasets and show how fairness for these datasets can be improved with a very small loss in accuracy.", "authors": ["Soheil Ghili", "Ehsan Kazemi", "Amin Karbasi"], "section": "AAAI Technical Track: Machine Learning"}, "When Do Words Matter? Understanding the Impact of Lexical Choice on Audience Perception Using Individual Treatment Effect Estimation": {"abstract": "Studies across many disciplines have shown that lexical choice can affect audience perception. For example, how users describe themselves in a social media profile can affect their perceived socio-economic status. However, we lack general methods for estimating the causal effect of lexical choice on the perception of a specific sentence. While randomized controlled trials may provide good estimates, they do not scale to the potentially millions of comparisons necessary to consider all lexical choices. Instead, in this paper, we first offer two classes of methods to estimate the effect on perception of changing one word to another in a given sentence. The first class of algorithms builds upon quasi-experimental designs to estimate individual treatment effects from observational data. The second class treats treatment effect estimation as a classification problem. We conduct experiments with three data sources (Yelp, Twitter, and Airbnb), finding that the algorithmic estimates align well with those produced by randomized-control trials.

To address this problem, we develop a novel deep cascade learning model, which progressively evolves from the documentlevel and paragraph-level ranking of candidate texts to more precise answer extraction with machine reading comprehension. Specifically, irrelevant documents and paragraphs are first filtered out with simple functions for efficiency consideration. Then we jointly train three modules on the remaining texts for better tracking the answer: the document extraction, the paragraph extraction and the answer extraction.

In this work, we study the problem of learning to master not one but multiple sequentialdecision tasks at once. A general issue in multi-task learning is that a balance must be found between the needs of multiple tasks competing for the limited resources of a single learning system. Many learning algorithms can get distracted by certain tasks in the set of tasks to solve.

Concretely, we leverage semantic relationship among the annotated points by encouraging the feature representations of the intra- and intercategory points to keep consistent, i.e. points within the same category should have more similar feature representations compared to those from different categories. We formulate such a characteristic into a simple distance metric loss, which collaborates with the point-wise cross-entropy loss to optimize the deep neural networks.

In order to tackle these problems, in this paper, we propose a multi-loop-view convolutional neural network (MLVCNN) framework for 3D shape retrieval.

In the view-level, a convolutional neural network is first trained to extract view features. Then, the proposed Loop Normalization and LSTM are utilized for each loop of view to generate the loop-level features, which considering the intrinsic associations of the different views in the same loop.

After generating a BLD for each landmark, the proposed method firstly learns the mappings from an image patch to the BLD of each landmark, and then the predicted BLDs are used in a deformable model fitting process to obtain the final facial shape for the image.

Two types of word representation are induced from the multi-lingual caption model: linguistic features and localized visual features. The linguistic feature is learned from the sentence contexts with visual semantic constraints, which is beneficial to learn translation for words that are less visual-relevant. The localized visual feature is attended to the region in the image that correlates to the word, so that it alleviates the image restriction for salient visual representation. The two types of features are complementary for word translation.

Given an independence system and candidate objective functions, we choose an independent set, and then an adversary chooses one objective function, knowing our choice. The goal is to find a randomized strategy (i.e., a probability distribution over the independent sets) that maximizes the expected objective value in the worst case. This problem is fundamental in wide areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, game theory and optimization. To solve the problem, we propose two types of schemes for designing approximation algorithms. One scheme is for the case when objective functions are linear. It first finds an approximately optimal aggregated strategy and then retrieves a desired solution with little loss of the objective value. The approximation ratio depends on a relaxation of an independence system polytope. As applications, we provide approximation algorithms for a knapsack constraint or a matroid intersection by developing appropriate relaxations and retrievals. The other scheme is based on the multiplicative weights update (MWU) method. The direct application of the MWU method does not yield a strict multiplicative approximation algorithm but yield one with an additional additive error term. A key technique to overcome the issue is to introduce a new concept called (\u03b7,\u03b3)-reductions for objective functions with parameters \u03b7 and \u03b3. We show that our scheme outputs a nearly \u03b1-approximate solution if there exists an \u03b1-approximation algorithm for a subproblem defined by (\u03b7,\u03b3)-reductions. This improves approximation ratios in previous results. Using our result, we provide approximation algorithms when the objective functions are submodular or correspond to the cardinality robustness for the knapsack problem.", "authors": ["Yasushi Kawase", "Hanna Sumita"], "section": "AAAI Technical Track: Reasoning under Uncertainty"}, "Recurrent Poisson Process Unit for Speech Recognition": {"abstract": "Over the past few years, there has been a resurgence of interest in using recurrent neural network-hidden Markov model (RNN-HMM) for automatic speech recognition (ASR). Some modern recurrent network models, such as long shortterm memory (LSTM) and simple recurrent unit (SRU), have demonstrated promising results on this task. Recently, several scientific perspectives in the fields of neuroethology and speech production suggest that human speech signals may be represented in discrete point patterns involving acoustic events in the speech signal. Based on this hypothesis, it may pose some challenges for RNN-HMM acoustic modeling: firstly, it arbitrarily discretizes the continuous input into the interval features at a fixed frame rate, which may introduce discretization errors; secondly, the occurrences of such acoustic events are unknown. Furthermore, the training targets of RNN-HMM are obtained from other (inferior) models, giving rise to misalignments. In this paper, we propose a recurrent Poisson process (RPP) which can be seen as a collection of Poisson processes at a series of time intervals in which the intensity evolves according to the RNN hidden states that encode the history of the acoustic signal. It aims at allocating the latent acoustic events in continuous time. Such events are efficiently drawn from the RPP using a sampling-free solution in an analytic form. The speech signal containing latent acoustic events is reconstructed/sampled dynamically from the discretized acoustic features using linear interpolation, in which the weight parameters are estimated from the onset of these events. The above processes are further integrated into an SRU, forming our final model, called recurrent Poisson process unit (RPPU). Experimental evaluations on ASR tasks including ChiME-2, WSJ0 and WSJ0&1 demonstrate the effectiveness and benefits of the RPPU. For example, it achieves a relative WER reduction of 10.7% over state-of-the-art models on WSJ0.", "authors": ["Hengguan Huang", "Hao Wang", "Brian Mak"], "section": "AAAI Technical Track: Natural Language Processing"}, "Identifying Android Malware Using Network-Based Approaches": {"abstract": "The proliferation of Android apps has resulted in many malicious apps entering the market and causing significant damage.

Usually, the lookahead policies are implemented with specific planning methods such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (e.g. in AlphaZero (Silver et al. 2017b)). Referring to the planning problem as tree search, a reasonable practice in these implementations is to back up the value only at the leaves while the information obtained at the root is not leveraged other than for updating the policy. Here, we question the potency of this approach. Namely, the latter procedure is non-contractive in general, and its convergence is not guaranteed. Our proposed enhancement is straightforward and simple: use the return from the optimal tree path to back up the values at the descendants of the root. This leads to a \u03b3h-contracting procedure, where \u03b3 is the discount factor and h is the tree depth.

However, forecasting event subtypes is far more complex than merely extending binary prediction to cover multiple classes, as 1) different locations require different models to handle their characteristic event subtype patterns due to spatial heterogeneity; 2) historically, many locations have only experienced a incomplete set of event subtypes, thus limiting the local model\u2019s ability to predict previously \u201cunseen\u201d subtypes; and 3) the subtle discrepancy among different event subtypes requires more discriminative and profound representations of societal events.

So far coloring problems are mostly studied on static graphs, which often stand in stark contrast to practice where data is inherently dynamic and subject to discrete changes over time. A temporal graph is a graph whose edges are assigned a set of integer time labels, indicating at which discrete time steps the edge is active. In this paper we present a natural temporal extension of the classical graph coloring problem. Given a temporal graph and a natural number \u2206, we ask for a coloring sequence for each vertex such that (i) in every sliding time window of \u2206 consecutive time steps, in which an edge is active, this edge is properly colored (i.e. its endpoints are assigned two different colors) at least once during that time window, and (ii) the total number of different colors is minimized. This sliding window temporal coloring problem abstractly captures many realistic graph coloring scenarios in which the underlying network changes over time, such as dynamically assigning communication channels to moving agents. We present a thorough investigation of the computational complexity of this temporal coloring problem. More specifically, we prove strong computational hardness results, complemented by efficient exact and approximation algorithms. Some of our algorithms are linear-time fixed-parameter tractable with respect to appropriate parameters, while others are asymptotically almost optimal under the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH).", "authors": ["George B.

Thus, in this paper we propose a multi-view lipreading to audio system, namely Lipper, which models it as a regression task. The model takes silent videos as input and produces speech as the output.

In this paper, we propose to compute more adaptive random Fourier features with optimized spectral samples (wj\u2019s) and feature weights (pj\u2019s).

The mixture weights focus on modeling spatial dependencies (i.e., shape) and the conditional probability distributions deal with intra-object variations (i.e., appearance). In addition, the background is separately modeled as a special component complementary to the foreground objects.

To reduce the reliance on time-consuming manual AU annotations, we propose a novel semi-supervised AU recognition method leveraging two kinds of readily available auxiliary information. The method leverages the dependencies between AUs and expressions as well as the dependencies among AUs, which are caused by facial anatomy and therefore embedded in all facial images, independent on their AU annotation status. The other auxiliary information is facial image synthesis given AUs, the dual task of AU recognition from facial images, and therefore has intrinsic probabilistic connections with AU recognition, regardless of AU annotations. Specifically, we propose a dual semi-supervised generative adversarial network for AU recognition from partially AU-labeled and fully expressionlabeled facial images. The proposed network consists of an AU classifier C, an image generator G, and a discriminator D. In addition to minimize the supervised losses of the AU classifier and the face generator for labeled training data, we explore the probabilistic duality between the tasks using adversary learning to force the convergence of the face-AU-expression tuples generated from the AU classifier and the face generator, and the ground-truth distribution in labeled data for all training data. This joint distribution also includes the inherent AU dependencies. Furthermore, we reconstruct the facial image using the output of the AU classifier as the input of the face generator, and create AU labels by feeding the output of the face generator to the AU classifier.

Most existing 3D shape retrieval methods focus on capturing strong discriminative shape representation with softmax loss for the classification task, while the shape feature learning with metric loss is neglected for 3D shape retrieval. In this paper, we address this problem based on the intuition that the cosine distance of shape embeddings should be close enough within the same class and far away across categories. Since most of 3D shape retrieval tasks use cosine distance of shape features for measuring shape similarity, we propose a novel metric loss named angular triplet-center loss, which directly optimizes the cosine distances between the features. It inherits the triplet-center loss property to achieve larger inter-class distance and smaller intra-class distance simultaneously. Unlike previous metric loss utilized in 3D shape retrieval methods, where Euclidean distance is adopted and the margin design is difficult, the proposed method is more convenient to train feature embeddings and more suitable for 3D shape retrieval. Moreover, the angle margin is adopted to replace the cosine margin in order to provide more explicit discriminative constraints on an embedding space.

Therefore, instead of using visual information as features, VistaNet relies on visual information as alignment for pointing out the important sentences of a document using attention.

To explore the inner relation of attribute and object as well as the intrinsic attribute-object representation, we propose a generative model with the encoder-decoder mechanism that bridges visual and linguistic information in a unified end-to-end network. The encoder-decoder mechanism presents the impressive potential to find an intrinsic attribute-object feature representation.

In this paper, we first leverage a robust feature descriptor, path signature (PS), and propose three PS features to explicitly represent the spatial and temporal motion characteristics, i.e., spatial PS (S PS), temporal PS (T PS) and temporal spatial PS (T S PS). Considering the significance of fine hand movements in the gesture, we propose an \u201dattention on hand\u201d (AOH) principle to define joint pairs for the S PS and select single joint for the T PS. In addition, the dyadic method is employed to extract the T PS and T S PS features that encode global and local temporal dynamics in the motion. Secondly, without the recurrent strategy, the classification model still faces challenges on temporal variation among different sequences. We propose a new temporal transformer module (TTM) that can match the sequence key frames by learning the temporal shifting parameter for each input. This is a learning-based module that can be included into standard neural network architecture.

A particular challenge of automatic idiom usage recognition is that idioms, by their very nature, are idiosyncratic in their usages; therefore, most previous work on idiom usage recognition mainly adopted a \u201cper idiom\u201d classifier approach, i.e., a classifier needs to be trained separately for each idiomatic expression of interest, often with the aid of annotated training examples. This paper presents a transferred learning approach for developing a generalized model to recognize whether an idiom is used figuratively or literally. Our work is based on the observation that most idioms, when taken literally, would be somehow semantically at odds with their context. Therefore, a quantified notion of semantic compatibility may help to discern the intended usage for any arbitrary idiom. We propose a novel semantic compatibility model by adapting the training of a Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) model for the purpose of idiom usage recognition.

Existing multi-view anomaly detection approaches have some issues, e.g., they assume multiple views of a normal instance share consistent and normal clustering structures while anomaly exhibits anomalous clustering characteristics across multiple views. When there are no clusters in data, it is difficult for existing approaches to detect anomalies. Besides, existing approaches construct a profile of normal instances, then identify instances that do not conform to the normal profile as anomalies. The objective is formulated to profile normal instances, but not to estimate the set of normal instances, which results in sub-optimal detectors. In addition, the model trained to profile normal instances uses the entire dataset including anomalies. However, anomalies could undermine the model, i.e., the model is not robust to anomalies. To address these issues, we propose the nearest neighborbased MUlti-View Anomaly Detection (MUVAD) approach. Specifically, we first propose an anomaly measurement criterion and utilize this criterion to formulate the objective of MUVAD to estimate the set of normal instances explicitly.

The circulant structure and models can be either trained from scratch or re-trained from a pre-trained non-circulant model, thereby making it very flexible for different training environments.

Experiments show the performance drastically drops when the number of views reduces, hindering these methods from practical applications. In this paper, we investigate the over-fitting issue and remove the constraint of the camera setting. First, two basic feature augmentation strategies Dropout and Dropview are introduced to solve the over-fitting issue, and a more precise and more efficient method named DropMax is proposed after analyzing the drawback of the basic ones. Then, by reducing the over-fitting issue, a camera constraint-free multi-view convolutional neural network named DeepCCFV is constructed.

By carefully studying the behavior of CNN models in the training process, we observe that the confusion level of two classes is strongly correlated with their angular separability in the feature space. That is, the larger the inter-class angle is, the lower the confusion will be. Based on this observation, we propose a novel loss function dubbed \u201cInter-Class Angular Loss\u201d (ICAL), which explicitly models the class correlation and can be directly applied to many existing deep networks. By minimizing the proposed ICAL, the networks can effectively discriminate the examples in similar classes by enlarging the angle between their corresponding class vectors.

Subsequent improvement adapts the preestimation in the form of a Softmax layer along with the training progress. However, the parameters in the Softmax layer are highly tweaked for the fragile performance and easily get stuck into undesired local minimums. To overcome this issue, we propose a Latent Class-Conditional Noise model (LCCN) that models the noise transition in a Bayesian form.

The instance classifier will be updated by following the empirical risk minimization principle and the strength of the constraints will be scaled by the projection confidences.

To handle such problems, inspired by transfer learning, we propose a simple yet effective unsupervised hashing method named Optimal Projection Guided Transfer Hashing (GTH) where we borrow the images of other different but related domain i.e., source domain to help learn precise hashing codes for the domain of interest i.e., target domain. Besides, we propose to seek for the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) solution of the hashing functions of target and source domains due to the domain gap. Furthermore, an alternating optimization method is adopted to obtain the two projections of target and source domains such that the domain hashing disparity is reduced gradually.

This further motivates the propagation of perturbations, which denotes that perturbations added on the current frame can transfer to the next frames via their temporal interactions. Thus, no (or few) extra perturbations are needed for these frames to misclassify them. To this end, we propose the first white-box video attack method, which utilizes an l2,1-norm based optimization algorithm to compute the sparse adversarial perturbations for videos. We choose the action recognition as the targeted task, and networks with a CNN+RNN architecture as threat models to verify our method.

The lack of a priori knowledge on the true number of underlying clusters in the dataset makes it important to have a metric to compare the clustering solutions with different number of clusters. This article quantifies a notion of persistence of clustering solutions that enables comparing solutions with different number of clusters. The persistence relates to the range of dataresolution scales over which a clustering solution persists; it is quantified in terms of the maximum over two-norms of all the associated cluster-covariance matrices. Thus we associate a persistence value for each element in a set of clustering solutions with different number of clusters. We show that the datasets where natural clusters are a priori known, the clustering solutions that identify the natural clusters are most persistent - in this way, this notion can be used to identify solutions with true number of clusters. Detailed experiments on a variety of standard and synthetic datasets demonstrate that the proposed persistence-based indicator outperforms the existing approaches, such as, gap-statistic method, X-means, Gmeans, PG-means, dip-means algorithms and informationtheoretic method, in accurately identifying the clustering solutions with true number of clusters.

Previous approaches do not leverage object information in images for this task. However, objects provide valuable cues to help predict the locations of caption regions as caption regions often highly overlap with objects (i.e. caption regions are usually parts of objects or combinations of them). Meanwhile, objects also provide important information for describing a target caption region as the corresponding description not only depicts its properties, but also involves its interactions with objects in the image. In this work, we propose a novel scheme with an object context encoding Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to automatically learn complementary object context for each caption region, transferring knowledge from objects to caption regions. All contextual objects are arranged as a sequence and progressively fed into the context encoding module to obtain context features. Then both the learned object context features and region features are used to predict the bounding box offsets and generate the descriptions. The context learning procedure is in conjunction with the optimization of both location prediction and caption generation, thus enabling the object context encoding LSTM to capture and aggregate useful object context.

If the targeted system is well-understood in terms of its causal components, one is able to design more precise and surgical interventions so as to bring certain desired outcomes about. The idea of leveraging the causal understanding of a system to improve decision-making has been studied in the literature under the rubric of structural causal bandits (Lee and Bareinboim, 2018). In this setting, (1) pulling an arm corresponds to performing a causal intervention on a set of variables, while (2) the associated rewards are governed by the underlying causal mechanisms. One key assumption of this work is that any observed variable (X) in the system is manipulable, which means that intervening and making do(X = x) is always realizable. In many real-world scenarios, however, this is a too stringent requirement. For instance, while scientific evidence may support that obesity shortens life, it\u2019s not feasible to manipulate obesity directly, but, for example, by decreasing the amount of soda consumption (Pearl, 2018). In this paper, we study a relaxed version of the structural causal bandit problem when not all variables are manipulable.

It is well known that the quality of the bounds achieved through this flexible bounding method is highly reliant on the ordering of variables chosen for building the diagram, and finding an ordering that optimizes standard metrics is an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we propose an innovative and generic approach based on deep reinforcement learning for obtaining an ordering for tightening the bounds obtained with relaxed and restricted DDs.

As one of the most widely used methods, matrix factorization typically uses continuous vectors to represent user/item latent features. However, the large volume of user/item latent features results in expensive storage and computation cost, particularly on terminal user devices where the computation resource to operate model is very limited. Thus when taking extra social information into account, precisely extracting K most relevant items for a given user from massive candidates tends to consume even more time and memory, which imposes formidable challenges for efficient and accurate recommendations. A promising way is to simply binarize the latent features (obtained in the training phase) and then compute the relevance score through Hamming distance. However, such a two-stage hashing based learning procedure is not capable of preserving the original data geometry in the real-value space and may result in a severe quantization loss. To address these issues, this work proposes a novel discrete social recommendation (DSR) method which learns binary codes in a unified framework for users and items, considering social information. We further put the balanced and uncorrelated constraints on the objective to ensure the learned binary codes can be informative yet compact, and finally develop an efficient optimization algorithm to estimate the model parameters.

Furthermore, iterative algorithms based on the reprojection distance are time-consuming for a large-scale problem. In contrast to previous works which minimize a cost function based on an algebraic distance that may not approximate the reprojection distance of the line, we design two simple algebraic distances to gradually approximate the reprojection distance. This speeds up the computation, and maintains the robustness of the geometric distance. The two algebraic distances result in two polynomial cost functions, which can be efficiently solved. We directly solve the first-order optimality conditions of the first problem with a novel hidden variable method. This algorithm makes use of the specific structure of the resulting polynomial system, therefore it is more stable than the general Gr\u00f6bner basis polynomial solver.

One primary challenge in hierarchical classification is the small training set issue of the local module. The local classifiers in the previous hierarchical classification approaches are prone to over-fitting, which becomes a major bottleneck of hierarchical classification. Fortunately, the labels in the local module are correlated, and the siblings of the true label can provide additional supervision information for the instance. This paper proposes a novel method to deal with the small training set issue. The key idea of the method is to represent the correlation among the labels by the label distribution. It generates a label distribution that contains the supervision information of each label for the given instance, and then learns a mapping from the instance to the label distribution.

However, a single unified projection matrix can hardly characterize all data similarities accurately as the practical data are usually very complicated, and simply adopting one global projection matrix might ignore important local patterns hidden in the dataset. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel method dubbed \u201cData-Adaptive Metric Learning\u201d (DAML), which constructs a data-adaptive projection matrix for each data pair by selectively combining a set of learned candidate matrices. As a result, every data pair can obtain a specific projection matrix, enabling the proposed DAML to flexibly fit the training data and produce discriminative projection results. The model of DAML is formulated as an optimization problem which jointly learns candidate projection matrices and their sparse combination for every data pair. Nevertheless, the over-fitting problem may occur due to the large amount of parameters to be learned. To tackle this issue, we adopt the Total Variation (TV) regularizer to align the scales of data embedding produced by all candidate projection matrices, and thus the generated metrics of these learned candidates are generally comparable. Furthermore, we extend the basic linear DAML model to the kernerlized version (denoted \u201cKDAML\u201d) to handle the non-linear cases, and the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) is employed to solve the optimization model.

In the model, a novel reward for each sample is devised to measure the degree of uncertainty, which is obtained from a classifier trained with existing labeled data. This reward is used to guide a conditional GAN to generate informative samples with a higher probability for a certain label. With extensive evaluations, we have confirmed the effectiveness of the model, showing that the generated samples are capable of improving the classification performance in popular image classification tasks.", "authors": ["Quan Kong", "Bin Tong", "Martin Klinkigt", "Yuki Watanabe", "Naoto Akira", "Tomokazu Murakami"], "section": "AAAI Technical Track: Machine Learning"}, "Pathological Evidence Exploration in Deep Retinal Image Diagnosis": {"abstract": "Though deep learning has shown successful performance in classifying the label and severity stage of certain disease, most of them give few evidence on how to make prediction.

However, such a processing might introduce undesired content change in the predicted region, especially when the desired content does not exist in the known region. To avoid generating such incorrect content, in this paper, we propose a content inference and style imitation network (CISI-net), which explicitly separate the image data into content code and style code. The content inference is realized by performing inference in the latent space to infer the content code of the corrupted images similar to the one from the original images. It can produce more detailed content than a similar inference procedure in the pixel domain, due to the dimensional distribution of content being lower than that of the entire image. On the other hand, the style code is used to represent the rendering of content, which will be consistent over the entire image. The style code is then integrated with the inferred content code to generate the complete image.

Unfortunately, they are sparingly available in many real-world applications. Particularly when performing classification over a non-stationary data stream, unavailability of sufficient labeled data undermines the classifier\u2019s long-term performance by limiting its adaptability to changes in data distribution over time. Recently, studies in such settings have appealed to transfer learning techniques over a data stream while detecting drifts in data distribution over time. Here, the data stream is represented by two independent non-stationary streams, one containing labeled data instances (called source stream) having a biased distribution compared to the unlabeled data instances (called target stream). The task of label prediction under this representation is called Multistream Classification, where instances in the two streams occur independently. While these studies have addressed various challenges in the multistream setting, it still suffers from large computational overhead mainly due to frequent bias correction and drift adaptation methods employed. In this paper, we focus on utilizing an alternative bias correction technique, called relative density-ratio estimation, which is known to be computationally faster. Importantly, we propose a novel mechanism to automatically learn an appropriate mixture of relative density that adapts to changes in the multistream setting over time.

Existing studies such as multiview learning show that it is promising to learn unified vector representations from all sources. However, high computational costs of incorporating heterogeneous information limit the applications of existing algorithms. The number of instances and dimensions of features in practice are often large. To bridge the gap, we propose a scalable framework FeatWalk, which can model and incorporate instance similarities in terms of different types of features into a unified embedding representation. To enable the scalability, FeatWalk does not directly calculate any similarity measure, but provides an alternative way to simulate the similarity-based random walks among instances to extract the local instance proximity and preserve it in a set of instance index sequences.

Our generalization to convex compact sets and convex losses allows us to develop new algorithms for several problems: regularized sequential decision making, regularized Nash equilibria in zero-sum extensive-form games, and computing approximate extensive-form perfect equilibria. Our generalization also leads to the first regret-minimization algorithm for computing reduced-normal-form quantal response equilibria based on minimizing local regrets. Experiments show that our framework leads to algorithms that scale at a rate comparable to the fastest variants of counterfactual regret minimization for computing Nash equilibrium, and therefore our approach leads to the first algorithm for computing quantal response equilibria in extremely large games.

This limitation stems from the fact that existing CNNs operate on deterministic numbers. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical convolutional neural network (SCNN), which extends existing CNN architectures but operates directly on correlated distributions rather than deterministic numbers. By introducing a parameterized canonical model to model correlated data and defining corresponding operations as required for CNN training and inference, we show that SCNN can process multiple frames of correlated images effectively, hence achieving significant speedup over existing CNN models. We use a CNN based video object detection as an example to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed SCNN as a general network model. Experimental results show that even a nonoptimized implementation of SCNN can still achieve 178% speedup over existing CNNs with slight accuracy degradation.", "authors": ["Tianchen Wang", "Jinjun Xiong", "Xiaowei Xu", "Yiyu Shi"], "section": "AAAI Technical Track: Machine Learning"}, "Mono3D++: Monocular 3D Vehicle Detection with Two-Scale 3D Hypotheses and Task Priors": {"abstract": "We present a method to infer 3D pose and shape of vehicles from a single image.

To reduce its sensitivity to 2D landmarks, we jointly model the 3D bounding box as a coarse representation which improves robustness.

However, most existing hashing methods are based on hand-crafted or raw level features of objects, which may not be optimally compatible with the coding process. Besides, these hashing methods are mainly designed to handle simple pairwise similarity. The complex multilevel ranking semantic structure of instances associated with multiple labels has not been well explored yet. In this paper, we propose a ranking-based deep cross-modal hashing approach (RDCMH). RDCMH firstly uses the feature and label information of data to derive a semi-supervised semantic ranking list. Next, to expand the semantic representation power of hand-crafted features, RDCMH integrates the semantic ranking information into deep cross-modal hashing and jointly optimizes the compatible parameters of deep feature representations and of hashing functions. Experiments on real multi-modal datasets show that RDCMH outperforms other competitive baselines and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal retrieval applications.", "authors": ["Xuanwu Liu", "Guoxian Yu", "Carlotta Domeniconi", "Jun Wang", "Yazhou Ren", "Maozu Guo"], "section": "AAAI Technical Track: Machine Learning"}, "A Unified Approach to Online Matching with Conflict-Aware Constraints": {"abstract": "Online bipartite matching and allocation models are widely used to analyze and design markets such as Internet advertising, online labor, and crowdsourcing.

Despite considerable efforts on automatic story generation in the past, prior work either is restricted in plot planning, or can only generate stories in a narrow domain. In this paper, we explore open-domain story generation that writes stories given a title (topic) as input. We propose a plan-and-write hierarchical generation framework that first plans a storyline, and then generates a story based on the storyline. We compare two planning strategies. The dynamic schema interweaves story planning and its surface realization in text, while the static schema plans out the entire storyline before generating stories. Experiments show that with explicit storyline planning, the generated stories are more diverse, coherent, and on topic than those generated without creating a full plan, according to both automatic and human evaluations.", "authors": ["Lili Yao", "Nanyun Peng", "Ralph Weischedel", "Kevin Knight", "Dongyan Zhao", "Rui Yan"], "section": "AAAI Technical Track: Natural Language Processing"}, "Realtime Generation of Audible Textures Inspired by a Video Stream": {"abstract": "We showcase a model to generate a soundscape from a camera stream in real time.

In this paper, we explore techniques to efficiently transfer the knowledge from these unlabeled utterances to improve model performance on Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) tasks. We use Embeddings from Language Model (ELMo) to take advantage of unlabeled data by learning contextualized word representations. Additionally, we propose ELMo-Light (ELMoL), a faster and simpler unsupervised pre-training method for SLU. Our findings suggest unsupervised pre-training on a large corpora of unlabeled utterances leads to significantly better SLU performance compared to training from scratch and it can even outperform conventional supervised transfer. Additionally, we show that the gains from unsupervised transfer techniques can be further improved by supervised transfer. The improvements are more pronounced in low resource settings and when using only 1000 labeled in-domain samples, our techniques match the performance of training from scratch on 10-15x more labeled in-domain data.", "authors": ["Aditya Siddhant", "Anuj Goyal", "Angeliki Metallinou"], "section": "AAAI Technical Track: Machine Learning"}, "A Recursive Algorithm for Projected Model Counting": {"abstract": "We present a recursive algorithm for projected model counting, i.e., the problem consisting in determining the number of models k\u2203X.\u03a3k of a propositional formula \u03a3 after eliminating from it a given set X of variables.

However, due to the diversity and complexity of biomedical image data, manual annotation for training common deep learning models is very timeconsuming and labor-intensive, especially because normally only biomedical experts can annotate image data well. Human experts are often involved in a long and iterative process of annotation, as in active learning type annotation schemes. In this paper, we propose representative annotation (RA), a new deep learning framework for reducing annotation effort in biomedical image segmentation. RA uses unsupervised networks for feature extraction and selects representative image patches for annotation in the latent space of learned feature descriptors, which implicitly characterizes the underlying data while minimizing redundancy. A fully convolutional network (FCN) is then trained using the annotated selected image patches for image segmentation. Our RA scheme offers three compelling advantages: (1) It leverages the ability of deep neural networks to learn better representations of image data; (2) it performs one-shot selection for manual annotation and frees annotators from the iterative process of common active learning based annotation schemes; (3) it can be deployed to 3D images with simple extensions. We evaluate our RA approach using three datasets (two 2D and one 3D) and show our framework yields competitive segmentation results comparing with state-of-the-art methods.", "authors": ["Hao Zheng", "Lin Yang", "Jianxu Chen", "Jun Han", "Yizhe Zhang", "Peixian Liang", "Zhuo Zhao", "Chaoli Wang", "Danny Z.

Despite the successful application of FM and its many deep learning variants, treating every feature interaction fairly may degrade the performance. For example, the interactions of a useless feature may introduce noises; the importance of a feature may also differ when interacting with different features. In this work, we propose a novel model named Interaction-aware Factorization Machine (IFM) by introducing Interaction-Aware Mechanism (IAM), which comprises the feature aspect and the field aspect, to learn flexible interactions on two levels. The feature aspect learns feature interaction importance via an attention network while the field aspect learns the feature interaction effect as a parametric similarity of the feature interaction vector and the corresponding field interaction prototype. IFM introduces more structured control and learns feature interaction importance in a stratified manner, which allows for more leverage in tweaking the interactions on both feature-wise and field-wise levels. Besides, we give a more generalized architecture and propose Interaction-aware Neural Network (INN) and DeepIFM to capture higher-order interactions. To further improve both the performance and efficiency of IFM, a sampling scheme is developed to select interactions based on the field aspect importance.

The multi-factorial evolutionary algorithm renders an effectual realization of evolutionary multitasking on two or three tasks. However, there remains room for improvement on the performance and capability of evolutionary multitasking. Beyond three tasks, this paper proposes a novel framework, called the symbiosis in biocoenosis optimization (SBO), to address evolutionary many-tasking optimization. The SBO leverages the notion of symbiosis in biocoenosis for transferring information and knowledge among different tasks through three major components: 1) transferring information through inter-task individual replacement, 2) measuring symbiosis through intertask paired evaluations, and 3) coordinating the frequency and quantity of transfer based on symbiosis in biocoenosis. The inter-task individual replacement with paired evaluations caters for estimation of symbiosis, while the symbiosis in biocoenosis provides a good estimator of transfer. This study examines the effectiveness and efficiency of the SBO on a suite of many-tasking benchmark problems, designed to deal with 30 tasks simultaneously. The experimental results show that SBO leads to better solutions and faster convergence than the state-of-the-art evolutionary multitasking algorithms. Moreover, the results indicate that SBO is highly capable of identifying the similarity between problems and transferring information appropriately.", "authors": ["Rung-Tzuo Liaw", "Chuan-Kang Ting"], "section": "AAAI Technical Track: Machine Learning"}}
